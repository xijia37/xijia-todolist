	It is assumed that you understand PHP and Mysql. If you need host the application in  a hosting company,
	you need understand the hosting company's directory structure for you domain. After all, installing PHP applications
	is basically copying files from one location to another.

	  <li>Create a mysql database</li>
	  <li>Launch http://yourhost/{your install dir}/install.php</li>
